# MyValuableProfits (MVP)

## Description

### Who is MVP?
MyValuableProfits (MVP) is a non-profit website where you can cherish your gains as a fellow Aussie stock trader.

### What is MVP?
Welcome to MyValuableProfits (MVP), a CS50x Final Project inspired by C$50's Finance Pset and brought to life by our own personal need for a flexible and fully customisable stock portfolio tracker. 

### When is MVP?
While many websites out there exist such as Sharesight, our goal is to say NO to the monetisation of such a simple yet essential tracker. We firmly believe this solves the problem of worldwide capitalism exploiting the lazy people who subscribe to paid websites such as Sharesight, and as a result, the charity that MVP provides means we expect to win our very own Nobel Peace Prize any day from now. 

### Where is MVP?

### Why is MVP?
The aim of this project was to practice CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) with SQL and Panda dataframes, and have a fully functioning, online, and open-source website for all users to traverse. The vast majority of this project have been written with Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS.
