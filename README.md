# MyValuableProfits (MVP)

## Description

### Who is MVP?
Welcome to MyValuableProfits (MVP), a not-for-profit website where you can track and cherish your gains as a fellow Aussie stock trader on the ASX and NASDAQ markets.

### What is MVP?
MVP is a CS50x Final Project inspired by C$50's Finance Pset and brought to life by our own personal need for a flexible fully customisable stock portfolio tracker (that is also free! More on this later). 

Current statistics of MVP:

### Where is MVP?
Rumors say MVP is currently finding the best gym equipment in town!

### Why is MVP?
The aim of this project was to practice CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) with SQL and Panda dataframes, and have a fully functioning, online, and open-source website for all users to traverse. While many websites out there exist such as Sharesight, our goal is to say NO to the monetisation of such a simple yet essential life changing tool. We firmly believe this solves the problem of worldwide capitalism exploiting the lazy people who subscribe to paid websites such as Sharesight, and as a result, the charity that MVP provides means we expect to win our very own Nobel Peace Prize very shortly.
